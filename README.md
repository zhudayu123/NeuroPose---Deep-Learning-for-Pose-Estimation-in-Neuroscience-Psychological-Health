- **Advanced Neural Architectures**:
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for spatial feature extraction.
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for temporal dependencies.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Reduces reliance on labeled data while improving robustness.
- **Adaptive Feedback Mechanism**: Refines predictions using contextual and domain-specific constraints.
- **High Accuracy & Computational Efficiency**: Optimized for real-time pose estimation.

## Framework Components
### 1. Multi-Modal Data Integration
- Merges data from **brain imaging, motion tracking, and behavioral sensors**.
- Handles **heterogeneous data formats** for comprehensive analysis.

### 2. Deep Learning Architecture
- **CNNs**: Extract key features from **video frames & imaging data**.
- **RNNs (LSTMs, GRUs)**: Model **temporal dynamics** in movement patterns.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Leverages unlabeled data for improved accuracy.

### 3. Adaptive Feedback Mechanism
